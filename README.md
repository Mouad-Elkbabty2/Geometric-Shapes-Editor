# Geometric Shapes Editor

## Overview
Geometric Shapes Editor is an interactive Java application that allows users to create, displace, and delete various geometric shapes using a JFrame GUI. This Maven-based project incorporates well-established design patterns, including Observer, Visitor, and Command, to provide a robust and extensible architecture.

## Features
- **Shape Operations**: Users can create, displace, or delete five different geometric shapes within the application.
- **Import/Export**: The shapes can be exported to or imported from JSON/XML files for ease of data management.
- **Undo/Redo Commands**: Implements undo and redo functionalities with `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y` keyboard shortcuts.
- **Maven Integration**: Uses Maven for dependency management, ensuring reliable build processes and modular design.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Observer**: Monitors changes in the shape states and updates the GUI in real-time.
  - **Visitor**: Allows operations to be performed on shapes without changing their class structures.
  - **Command**: Encapsulates actions as objects, enabling undo/redo capabilities.

## Getting Started
To run this application, make sure you have Maven installed and set up on your machine.

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Use the following Maven commands:

```bash
mvn clean install    # Compiles the project and builds the JAR file.
mvn exec:java        # Executes the main class of the project.
```

## Design
The application's codebase is structured to accommodate changes and extensions. Shape code is modularly managed within a JAR file declared in the main Maven POM.
